# Initialize Materialize with Three-Tier Architecture
# Run this after docker-compose up to set up Materialize
#
# Architecture:
#   ingest cluster  -> Sources (PostgreSQL logical replication)
#   compute cluster -> Materialized views (persist transformation results)
#   serving cluster -> Indexes (serve queries with low latency)
#
# Pattern:
#   - Regular views for intermediate transformations (no cluster)
#   - Materialized views IN CLUSTER compute for "topmost" views that serve results
#   - Indexes IN CLUSTER serving ON materialized views

# 3. Store Capacity Health MV - monitors store utilization and capacity constraints
#
# CAPACITY MODEL EXPLANATION:
# - Hourly capacity (store_capacity_orders_per_hour): Number of new orders a store can accept per hour
# - Concurrent capacity: Total number of orders a store can handle simultaneously
#   Formula: hourly_rate × average_fulfillment_time
#
# The 4-hour multiplier represents the average fulfillment time for same-day delivery:
#   - Order placed → Picking (1-2 hours) → Packing (30 min) → Delivery (1-2 hours)
#   - This allows orders to arrive continuously while previous orders are still being fulfilled
#
# Example: A store with 10 orders/hour capacity can handle 40 concurrent orders
#   - New orders arrive at 10/hour
#   - Each order takes ~4 hours to complete
#   - At steady state: 40 orders in various stages of fulfillment
#
# Utilization is calculated as: active_orders / concurrent_capacity
# This gives a more accurate view of store workload than comparing to hourly intake rate alone.
