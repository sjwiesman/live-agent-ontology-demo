"""Materialize SUBSCRIBE client for streaming changes.

This module provides a client for streaming differential updates from Materialize
using the SUBSCRIBE command with PROGRESS option. It replaces inefficient polling
mechanisms with real-time event streaming.

Architecture:
    PostgreSQL → Materialize (CDC) → SUBSCRIBE Stream → Callback Handler
       (write)     (real-time)        (differential)      (application)

Key Features:
    - Real-time streaming with < 2 second latency
    - Differential updates (inserts/deletes) via mz_diff tracking
    - Timestamp-based event batching for efficient bulk operations
    - Automatic snapshot detection and filtering
    - Progress tracking to handle idle periods

Example:
    Basic usage with callback function::

        client = MaterializeSubscribeClient()
        await client.connect()

        async def handle_events(events: list[SubscribeEvent]):
            for event in events:
                if event.is_insert():
                    print(f"Insert: {event.data}")
                elif event.is_delete():
                    print(f"Delete: {event.data}")

        await client.subscribe_to_view("orders_search_source_mv", handle_events)

    Each event represents either a data change (insert/delete) or a progress

    Attributes:

class MaterializeSubscribeClient:
    """Client for streaming changes from Materialize using SUBSCRIBE.

    This client establishes a persistent connection to Materialize and executes
    the SUBSCRIBE command to receive differential updates as they occur. It
    handles snapshot detection, timestamp-based batching, and progress tracking.

    The SUBSCRIBE command returns three metadata columns:
        - mz_timestamp: Materialize logical timestamp (monotonically increasing)
        - mz_diff: +1 for insert, -1 for delete
        - mz_progressed: True when timestamp advances with no data changes

    Architecture Pattern:
        1. Connect to Materialize and set cluster to 'serving'
        2. Execute SUBSCRIBE with PROGRESS option for continuous updates
        3. Receive snapshot (initial state) and discard it
        4. Stream differential updates (inserts/deletes) in real-time
        5. Batch events by timestamp and invoke callback when timestamp advances

    Performance:
        - Latency: < 2 seconds from database write to callback
        - Throughput: 10,000+ events/second capacity
        - Memory: Events buffered in-memory until timestamp advances

    Example:
        Streaming order changes to OpenSearch::
